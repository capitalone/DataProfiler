# Data Profiler | What's in your data?

The DataProfiler is a Python library designed to make data analysis, monitoring and **sensitive data detection** easy.

Loading **Data** with a single command, the library automatically formats & loads files into a DataFrame. **Profiling** the Data, the library identifies the schema, statistics, entities (PII / NPI) and more. Data Profiles can then be used in downstream applications or reports.

Getting started only takes a few lines of code ([example csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capitalone/DataProfiler/main/dataprofiler/tests/data/csv/aws_honeypot_marx_geo.csv)):

```python
import json
from dataprofiler import Data, Profiler

data = Data("your_file.csv") # Auto-Detect & Load: CSV, AVRO, Parquet, JSON, Text, URL

print(data.data.head(5)) # Access data directly via a compatible Pandas DataFrame

profile = Profiler(data) # Calculate Statistics, Entity Recognition, etc

readable_report = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "compact"})

print(json.dumps(readable_report, indent=4))
```
Note: The Data Profiler comes with a pre-trained deep learning model, used to efficiently identify **sensitive data** (PII / NPI). If desired, it's easy to add new entities to the existing pre-trained model or insert an entire new pipeline for entity recognition.

For API documentation, visit the [documentation page](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/).

If you have suggestions or find a bug, [please open an issue](https://github.com/capitalone/dataprofiler/issues/new/choose).

------------------

# Install

**To install the full package from pypi**: `pip install DataProfiler[full]`

If you want to install the ml dependencies without generating reports use `DataProfiler[ml]`

If the ML requirements are too strict (say, you don't want to install tensorflow), you can install a slimmer package with `DataProfiler[reports]`. The slimmer package disables the default sensitive data detection / entity recognition (labler)

Install from pypi: `pip install DataProfiler`


# Contribute
If you want to install the dependencies for developing and updating the code base, be sure to run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

## Pre-Commit
To install `pre-commit` hooks, run the following commands:

```cli
pre-commit install
pre-commit run
```

If you want to run the `pre-commit` fresh over over all the files, run the following:
```cli
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing
Before running unit tests, make sure you install the testing dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt`.

To execute unit tests, run the following
```cli
DATAPROFILER_SEED=0 python3 -m unittest discover -p "test*.py"
```

For more nuanced testing runs, check out more detailed documentation [here](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/docs/0.7.11/html/install.html#testing).

# What is a Data Profile?

In the case of this library, a data profile is a dictionary containing statistics and predictions about the underlying dataset. There are "global statistics" or `global_stats`, which contain dataset level data and there are "column/row level statistics" or `data_stats` (each column is a new key-value entry).

The format for a structured profile is below:

```
"global_stats": {
    "samples_used": int,
    "column_count": int,
    "row_count": int,

# Get Started

### Load a File

The Data Profiler can profile the following data/file types:

* CSV file (or any delimited file)
* JSON object
* Avro file
* Parquet file
* Text file
* Pandas DataFrame
* A URL that points to one of the supported file types above

The profiler should automatically identify the file type and load the data into a `Data Class`.

Along with other attributtes the `Data class` enables data to be accessed via a valid Pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Load a csv file, return a CSVData object
csv_data = Data('your_file.csv')

# Print the first 10 rows of the csv file
print(csv_data.data.head(10))

# Load a parquet file, return a ParquetData object
parquet_data = Data('your_file.parquet')

# Sort the data by the name column
parquet_data.data.sort_values(by='name', inplace=True)

# Print the sorted first 10 rows of the parquet data
print(parquet_data.data.head(10))

# Load a json file from a URL, return a JSONData object
json_data = Data('https://github.com/capitalone/DataProfiler/blob/main/dataprofiler/tests/data/json/iris-utf-8.json')
```

If the file type is not automatically identified (rare), you can specify them
specifically, see section [Specifying a Filetype or Delimiter](#specifying-a-filetype-or-delimiter).

### Profile a File

Example uses a CSV file for example, but CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet or Text also work.

```python
import json
from dataprofiler import Data, Profiler

# Load file (CSV should be automatically identified)
data = Data("your_file.csv")

# Profile the dataset
profile = Profiler(data)

# Generate a report and use json to prettify.
report  = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})

# Print the report
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))
```

### Updating Profiles

Currently, the data profiler is equipped to update its profile in batches.

```python
import json
from dataprofiler import Data, Profiler

# Load and profile a CSV file
data = Data("your_file.csv")
profile = Profiler(data)

# Update the profile with new data:
new_data = Data("new_data.csv")
profile.update_profile(new_data)

# Print the report using json to prettify.
report  = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))
```

Note that if the data you update the profile with contains integer indices that overlap with the indices on data originally profiled, when null rows are calculated the indices will be "shifted" to uninhabited values so that null counts and ratios are still accurate.

### Merging Profiles

If you have two files with the same schema (but different data), it is possible to merge the two profiles together via an addition operator.

This also enables profiles to be determined in a distributed manner.

```python
import json
from dataprofiler import Data, Profiler

# Load a CSV file with a schema
data1 = Data("file_a.csv")
profile1 = Profiler(data1)

# Load another CSV file with the same schema
data2 = Data("file_b.csv")
profile2 = Profiler(data2)

profile3 = profile1 + profile2

# Print the report using json to prettify.
report  = profile3.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))
```

Note that if merged profiles had overlapping integer indices, when null rows are calculated the indices will be "shifted" to uninhabited values so that null counts and ratios are still accurate.

### Profiler Differences
For finding the change between profiles with the same schema we can utilize the
profile's `diff` function. The diff will provide overall file and sampling
differences as well as detailed differences of the data's statistics. For
example, numerical columns have a t-test applied to evaluate similarity.
More information is described in the Profiler section of the [Github Pages](
https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/).

Create the difference report like this:
```python
import json
import dataprofiler as dp

# Load a CSV file
data1 = dp.Data("file_a.csv")
profile1 = dp.Profiler(data1)

# Load another CSV file
data2 = dp.Data("file_b.csv")
profile2 = dp.Profiler(data2)

diff_report = profile1.diff(profile2)
print(json.dumps(diff_report, indent=4))
```

### Profile a Pandas DataFrame
```python
import pandas as pd
import dataprofiler as dp
import json

my_dataframe = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2.0],[1, 2.2],[-1, 3]])
profile = dp.Profiler(my_dataframe)

# print the report using json to prettify.
report = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))

# read a specified column, in this case it is labeled 0:
print(json.dumps(report["data_stats"][0], indent=4))
```

### Unstructured Profiler
In addition to the structured profiler, DataProfiler provides unstructured profiling for the TextData object or string. The unstructured profiler also works with list[string], pd.Series(string) or pd.DataFrame(string) given profiler_type option specified as `unstructured`. Below is an example of the unstructured profiler with a text file.
```python
import dataprofiler as dp
import json

my_text = dp.Data('text_file.txt')
profile = dp.Profiler(my_text)

# print the report using json to prettify.
report = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))
```

Another example of the unstructured profiler with pd.Series of strings is given as below, with the profiler option `profiler_type='unstructured'`
```python
import dataprofiler as dp
import pandas as pd
import json

text_data = pd.Series(['first string', 'second string'])
profile = dp.Profiler(text_data, profiler_type='unstructured')

# print the report using json to prettify.
report = profile.report(report_options={"output_format": "pretty"})
print(json.dumps(report, indent=4))
```

### Graph Profiler
DataProfiler also provides the ability to profile graph data from a csv file. Below is an example of the graph profiler with a graph data csv file:
```python
import dataprofiler as dp
import pprint

my_graph = dp.Data('graph_file.csv')
profile = dp.Profiler(my_graph)

# print the report using pretty print (json dump does not work on numpy array values inside dict)
report = profile.report()
printer = pprint.PrettyPrinter(sort_dicts=False, compact=True)
printer.pprint(report)
```
